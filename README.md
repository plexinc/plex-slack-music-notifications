| `SLACK_APP_SIGNING_SECRET` | Signing Secret |

## Configure the Webhook

Once the Slack app has been provisioned and this app's environment variables have been configured, visit the root of the running app again to tbe begin the Slack oauth process.
* Install the app for your Slack user
* Click the `Connect Plex Account` button and sign in to your Plex account
* Configure your webhook url
   * The `playEmoji` and `pauseEmoji` are used as your Slack account's status emoji
